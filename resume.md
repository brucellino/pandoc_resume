Profile
-------

Bruce Becker completed his studies in 2007 with a Ph.D in physics from the University of Cape Town, working on the High-Level Trigger of the ALICE  Dimuon Spectrometer at the CERN LHC. He completed two postdoctoral fellowships at the CEA (Saclay, France) and INFN (Cagliari, Italy), extending his work on ALICE and moving into the area of HPC and grid computing. With a strong analytical and technical background, his work consisted mainly of the development and optimisation of algorithms and integration of online and offline workflows. Gaining experience through working in teams and large collaborations, he developed the management, communication, planning and organisational skills to undertake research and development projects at national scale.\
In 2008 he kickstarted the South African National Grid (SAGrid) – a federation of compute resources providers from research groups, universities and national research laboratories in South Africa. In collaboration with several European projects, he coordinated the deployment of HPC and data resources, including the training of users and technical staff, as well as the identification and porting of several scientific applications. The culmination of this phase resulted in the harmonisation of the initiative with other South African e-Infrastructure initiatives, such as the National Research Network (SANREN) and the formation of the Africa-Arabia Regional Operations Centre (AAROC).\
A strong believer in the Open Access and Open Science movement, his current research interests are fall into e-Infrastructure and scientific research domains. His current responsibilities involve ensuring the availability and development of a pan-African platform for scientific collaboration, as well as maintaining interoperability with other regional infrastructures such as EGI. He remains active in education and training, developing tools and techniques for 21st century research and collaboration. Personal interests include music, neuroscience, impact of climate change, travel, history, the solar system, outdoor activities and languages.

Education
---------

Ph.D (Physics)
:   University of Cape Town

Graduated
:   2007

Thesis title
:   **Design, implementation and physics performance of the ALICE dimuon spectrometer High-Level Trigger (dHLT).**

Short description
:   The dimuon spectrometer of the ALICE experiment at the LHC aims to investigate the properties of the system created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion nuclear collisions, by using heavy quarkonia (J/$\psi$ and Upsilon families) as a probe. These mesons are predicted to be produced in abundance at the LHC, but have a small cross-section for decay into dimuon pairs. In order to extract a significant signal from the large muon background sources, a High-Level Trigger (dHLT) has been developed to extend the capabilities of the detector. My thesis details the development and implementation of the dHLT and investigates the improvement in the measurement of the heavy quarkonia signals with this dHLT in place, with the use of Monte-Carlo simulations of heavy-ion collisions and a simulation of the detector response.

------------------------------------------------------

M.Sc (Physics)
:   University of Cape Town

Graduated
:   December 2002

Thesis Title
:   Reaction mechanisms of low-energy heavy-ion nuclear physics.

Short Description of project
:   The project involved the analysis of data taken at iThemba LABS, near Cape Town, over a period of 2 years from 2000 – 2002. The work involved data-taking shifts at the laboratory and various analyses, including detector calibration and discussion of the results with collaborators at the University of Milan. Two presentations of the work were made to the South African Institute of Physics (SAIP, 2000 and 2001) and a prize for best presentation by a M.Sc. student was won in 2001. Preliminary results were presented at the 2nd International Balkan School on Nuclear Physics, in Bodrum, Turkey in 2000. Results from the thesis helped to construct a comprehensive theory of reaction mechanisms in heavy-ion collisions in the energy range of 100 - 400 MeV.
